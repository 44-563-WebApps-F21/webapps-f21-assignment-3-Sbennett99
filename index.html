    <h4>
        My Favorite Location: Saint Thomas, VI
    </h4>
    <p>
        This location is an Island
         in the <b>Caribean</b>. It's very
         beautiful there and the             water is crystal clear.
         Sadly, because of climate
         change, some of the reefs
         have actually <b>died</b>, but it
         is still beautiful none the less.
