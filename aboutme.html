            My superhero isn't very special as heros
            come. He doesnt have super speed, or
            strengh, or inteligence, but what he 
            does have in the uncanny ability to 
            find shade to stand in to cool off on
            a hot day. That's how he got his name, 
            always helping people find shade on the 
            hottest days of work. Furthermore, his 
            biggest weakness is hot, high humidity days
            with no wind. This is because it makes the
            shade feel almost useless.
